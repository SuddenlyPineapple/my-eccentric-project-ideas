Repo for storing interesting and eccentric projects ideas for future ;)

## List of project ideas

1. ðŸš€ Build self-landing rocket using Arduino, accelerometer, and motors with 3d printed wings just to stabilize landing, idea is to create something like SpaceX rockets but in small size. Optionally some sensors could be added to measure flight parameters. <br />âœ… Done (but it's not self-landing, more like just fly tracker)- Repository link: [put-V2-rocket](https://github.com/SuddenlyPineapple/put-V2-rocket)

2. âœŒ Robotic arm controlled with sensors attached to head or arm.

3. ðŸ›° 3D map of satellites around the globe using WebAssembly and Google Maps API.

4. ðŸ˜´ Hypnotizing app to help people go to sleep.

5. ðŸš— OLED Display connected through Arduino & MCP2515 to car CAN bus network, which displays previously unavailable on stock dash information about oil temperature, oil pressure, tire pressure, etc.
<br />ðŸŸ  In progress - Repository link: [subaru_brz_oled_canbus_sniffer](https://github.com/SuddenlyPineapple/subaru_brz_oled_canbus_sniffer)

6. ðŸ’¦ Simple water level sensor with solar panels and long lasting battery. It can be created with super-capacitors in combination with solar panels or using traditional lithium-ion batteries. Also it's should be water proof (or more like water condensation proof, which is a bit of a challange).
<br />ðŸŸ  In progress - for now without repo (it's developed using ESP_Easy)
