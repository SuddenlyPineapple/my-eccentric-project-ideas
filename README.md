Repo for storing interesting and eccentric projects ideas for future ;)

## List of project ideas

1. ðŸš€ Build self-landing rocket using Arduino, accelerometer, and motors with 3d printed wings just to stabilize landing, idea is to create something like SpaceX rockets but in small size. Optionally some sensors could be added to measure flight parameters.

2. âœŒ Robotic arm controlled with sensors attached to head or arm.

3. ðŸ›° 3D map of satellites around the globe using WebAssembly and Google Maps API.

4. ðŸ˜´ Hypnotizing app to help people go to sleep.

5. AI teacher bot. Think how cool it would be if you have a teacher who knows literally everything! And is there for you whenever you need her! AI assistants like Alexa and Google can do so much gives me hope that this project can be really possible. Training the the bot with different lecture videos available all over the internet for free would help to achieve even better results. One problem with recorded videos is they can't solve doubts if any. This bot sure would be able to.
