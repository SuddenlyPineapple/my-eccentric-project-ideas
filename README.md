1. ðŸš€ Build self-landing rocket using Arduino, accelerometer, and motors with 3d printed wings just to stabilize landing, idea is to create something like SpaceX rockets but in small size. Optionally some sensors could be added to measure flight parameters.

2. âœŒ Robotic arm controlled with sensors attached to head or arm.

3. ðŸ›° 3D map of satellites around the globe using WebAssembly and Google Maps API.
