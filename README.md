Repo for storing interesting and eccentric projects ideas for future ;)

## List of project ideas

1. ðŸš€ Build self-landing rocket using Arduino, accelerometer, and motors with 3d printed wings just to stabilize landing, idea is to create something like SpaceX rockets but in small size. Optionally some sensors could be added to measure flight parameters. <br />âœ… Done (but it's not self-landing, more like just fly tracker)- Repository link: [put-V2-rocket](https://github.com/SuddenlyPineapple/put-V2-rocket)

2. âœŒ Robotic arm controlled with sensors attached to head or arm.

3. ðŸ›° 3D map of satellites around the globe using WebAssembly and Google Maps API.

4. ðŸ˜´ Hypnotizing app to help people go to sleep.

5. ðŸš— OLED Display connected through Arduino & MCP2515 to car CAN bus network, which displays previously unavailable on stock dash information about oil temperature, oil pressure, tire pressure, etc.
<br />ðŸŸ  In progress - Repository link: [subaru_brz_oled_canbus_sniffer](https://github.com/SuddenlyPineapple/subaru_brz_oled_canbus_sniffer)

6. ðŸ’¦ Simple water level sensor with solar panels and long lasting battery. It can be created with super-capacitors in combination with solar panels or using traditional lithium-ion batteries. Also it's should be water proof (or more like water condensation proof, which is a bit of a challange).
<br />ðŸŸ  In progress - for now without repo (it's developed using ESP_Easy, most configurations happen in UI, as of 18.10.2023 it works, but I've had problems with rust when sensor was used outside, so now I wait for new solar panel and I'll try to save it from rusting somehow).

7. ðŸ’¾ Repository with BIOS bins for various motherboards, I think right to repair is important and it's a bit of a challenge to find BIOS for older motherboards, so I think it's a good idea to create a repository with BIOS bins for various motherboards, so people can download and flash it to their motherboards. Also it's a good idea to create a repository with schematics for various motherboards, it can be helpful and will reduce amount of electronic waste. Maybe when it will be open-source the community itself will grow.

8. ðŸ“±Ansible repository with quick guide how to run basic home-server with various useful Docker containers. F.ex. Homeassitant, PiHole, Jellyfin, OpenMediaValut/TrueNAS, WatchTower, Octoprint, Swag reverse proxy etc. It can be useful for people who want to start their adventure with home servers. I know repos like this exists, but they are cut for specific needs. I would want to create something more generic, like configs in swag proxy, but for whole server. In essence, you just need to uncomment containers that you want on server and run ansible playbook.
